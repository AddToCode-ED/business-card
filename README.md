## About
This project is a simple webpage for Edwin Serrano, designed using HTML and CSS. The page includes a section for an image and basic styling.

## Files
- `index.html` - The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- `styles.css` - The CSS file that provides styling to the webpage.

## How to Use
1. Download both `index.html` and `styles.css` files.
2. Place them in the same directory.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the webpage.

## Image Placement
Replace `image.jpg` in the HTML file with your own image file. Ensure the image is in the same directory as `index.html` or update the image path accordingly.

## Customization
- Modify `styles.css` to change colors, fonts, or layout as needed.
- Edit `index.html` to add more content or personalize the page further.
